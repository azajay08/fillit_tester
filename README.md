# fillit_tester - 42 (Hive Helsinki)
This is a tester for the 42 (Hive Helsinki) project - fillit

This is a combination of test for the project fillit. It includes 
the basic evaluation tests, some error handling tests, some random
solver tests, a test for every possible valid piece and a test for
26 pieces.

# Instructions
git clone https://github.com/azajay08/fillit_tester.git fillit_tester  
into your project directory. **cd** into the fillit_tester directory  
To run the tests, for example type, "sh 1basic_eval.sh" (without " ")
There are 5 tests in total, so just type the test file after the **sh**. It works if the makefile is in the root of the project, if not, just change the path on the **sh** files.
